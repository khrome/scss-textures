SCSS Textures
=============

I often use [CSS textures](https://leaverou.github.io/css3patterns/#) to do early prototypes, but I usually wind up hand altering them. Also I tend to use SCSS as a project matures, so I figured I'd macro-ize all the textures I use.

That's what this is, just include the scss file, and go to town.
